A simple linux script which can automatically install Java 8, 11, and 14. All with little to no hassle
You ought to manually download the JDK/JRE of the Java version of your choosing from orcale.com, alternatively, you can also download the JDK/JRE from java.com, this is because the script doesn't download these files, the reasons are:

1. The links die out quickly
And 2. I don't wanna do it just to be on the safe side, I'm also a lazy bitch
